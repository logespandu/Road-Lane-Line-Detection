# Road-Lane-Line-Detection
In a Road Lane Line Detection project, the goal is to boost road safety by detecting lane markings using computer vision techniques like edge detection and Hough Transform. The process involves collecting road images, preprocessing them, and identifying lane lines. This tech aids in autonomous vehicle navigation and driver assistance systems.
